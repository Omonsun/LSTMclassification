# ⏳ RNN-Based Time Series Classification  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** for **time series classification**. Time series classification involves predicting categorical labels based on sequential data. The model is trained on a dataset with **temporal dependencies**, leveraging the strengths of RNN-based architectures.  

### ✅ **Objectives**  
- Develop a **time series classification** model using **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**.  
- Explore **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** and **Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)** for performance comparison.  
- Improve classification accuracy by handling **temporal dependencies** effectively.  
- Evaluate the model's effectiveness using **various performance metrics**.
